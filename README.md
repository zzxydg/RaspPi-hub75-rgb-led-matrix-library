# RaspPi-hub75-rgb-led-matrix-library

RGB LED Matrix code built around the library created by Henner Zeller

The library can be found on GitHub here: https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix

The code in this repository is very much work in progress with little documentation at the moment.

Enjoy!
